one player blackjack


This is my first real attempt at creating a JavaScript project on my own, without the aid of tutorials. 
It took me a couple of hours to complete the inital build and another couple of hours of trying to figure out bugs.

# gameplay

The object of the game is to be dealt one card at a time, trying to get as close to a score of 21 as possible without going over.
On the playing table you are presented with a 'hit me' button and a 'stay' button. The 'hit me' button will prompt another card to be dealt.
If you go over 21 points without hitting the 'stay button you lose the hand and will be asked to confirm if you would like to play again.
If you are satisfied with the hand you are dealt, hit 'stay'. Your score will be compared to the dealers. If you are closer to 21 points than the dealer you win,
if not, you lose.

Good luck!

# future updates

-Show dealer's first card & the remainder of the dealer's hand once the player hits the 'stay' button.

-Multi-player version, allowing multiple seats at the table, all playing against the dealer.
